About
This was from a school exam in agile project where kolonial.no was our target.
Our mission was to give this company a new idea or solution to their existing system. 
We were a group of 8 people who decided to make a webpage with an application similar to it in only 2 weeks. 
I decided to try to take care of the mobile application on my own even though i had very litle knowledge in 
hybrid application. The app is not fully completed yet due to short period of developement, but i will hopefully 
be able to finish it soon. 

Note: the classes are not the proper way of writing codes( i.e missing some property classes that could be used instead of the repeating the same functions in different classses)
